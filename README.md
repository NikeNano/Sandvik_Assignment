#Sandvik_DataScience_TakeHome

The Code @ Sandvik take homea assignment

My solution to the following problem:https://github.com/sandvikcode/data-science-take-home

Includes the following steps:

1. Webscraping and downloading the files(zip files), also create a csv file for the preprocessing scrip - web_download_prepare.ipynb
2. R script for feature extraction from the .wav files. - sound_feature.R
3. Some further feature extraction and transformation, also some visualisation of the data. - visualisng_preprocessed_data.ipynb
4. Modelling and futher understanding of the data. - Predictive modelling.ipynb
5. Bokeh application for interactive plots and visualisation of the data - bokeh_app 
6. PDF report done in latex (online editor).


Please note that due to problems with the versioning and more specifically that my girlfriend had borrowed my GCE server for her master thesis resulted in that it looked like I had pushed code from two accounts. I therefore moved the code to a new repository. I have done all the code my self and if any problems would be more than happy to illustrate the problem and go through all the code and in person to show that it is mine.
