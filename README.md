My solution to the following problem:https://github.com/sandvikcode/data-science-take-home

Includes the following steps:

1. Webscraping and downloading the files(zip files), also create a csv file for the preprocessing scrip - web_download_prepare.ipynb
2. R script for feature extraction from the .wav files. - sound_feature.R
3. Some further feature extraction and transformation, also some visualisation of the data. - visualisng_preprocessed_data.ipynb
4. Modelling and futher understanding of the data. - Predictive modelling.ipynb
5. Bokeh application for interactive plots and visualisation of the data - bokeh_app
